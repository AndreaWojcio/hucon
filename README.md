![HuCon](webserver/static/images/Logo.svg)

This project was created to teach children how to program a self-built robot.
The basis is the Omega2+ from www.onion.io. Beside WLAN and the integrated Python this offers a good basis.

The main module is the webserver, which provides a [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/) website with user-defined modules. The custom modules are used for the hardware to build your own robots.
A Python web server provides the website to program and control the robot from there in Blockly or Python.

Check out our [documentation](https://basler.github.io/hucon/) to learn how to install the HuCon software on your Omega2+.
