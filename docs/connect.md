# Connect

Before you can start programming, your HuCon must first be started. Connect your Hucon with a USB-C cable to power it. After a short time the LEDs of your robot will turn red.

Your robot will show that it is starting. Now it won't take to long and the LED's will turn yellow and then green. As soon as the LED's turn of, your HuCon is ready to go.
