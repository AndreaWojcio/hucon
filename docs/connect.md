# Connect

Before you can work with the HuCon, it has to be powered up and running. The power delivery can be made with an
micro USB cable and a standard smartphone charger with an ampere rating of 500 milliamps.
The LEDs on the head should light up/turn red shortly after supplying the power and indicate that the system is booting.

The LEDs will soon show yellow and green while the webservice is starting and finally turn off when your HuCon is up and ready to go.

## Connect to the WLAN
Your HuCon provides its own network where you can log in with your PC, tablet or mobile phone.
The network name always starts with Omega-**XXXX**. The last four characters are highlighted bold on the back of your HuCon and the network password is always **12345678**.

Your HuCon is providing a homepage on port 8080 and can be reached after you have connected to the WLAN of your HuCon at http://Omega-XXXX.local:8080 or http://192.168.3.1:8080.
