# Blockly

Blockly is an excellent way to learn programming. Simple blocks are connected to each other to represent a sequence of the program.
To program your HuCon with the Blockly blocks you just have to click on the **Blockly** tile on the start page.

If you don't know how to start, just have a look at the provided examples. You can open all examples and save them under a new name if you have changed them.

## Main menu
The main menu has some sub menus to load/save your workspace or start/stop your program. Additionally, the menu can be used to show/hide the code or the log output.

### File
Under this menu item you will find everything you need to load or save your program. If you simply want to create a new program, you can also use this menu.

### Start/Stop
With these two buttons you can start or stop the program you have in your workspace.

### Console/Code
Hide or show the output or the code. Just as you need it for your work.

### Buttons
You can create your own software buttons with the event blocks. The buttons will work similar to a virtual remote control. Just click on **Buttons** to display the virtual remote control.

## Blocks
On the left side you will find a menu with many blocks that you can use for programming.

## Workspace
On the workspace your program is created. Just connect a few blocks and start your program to see what happens. You are also welcome to take a look at the included examples and try them out.

## Code
Code is generated from the blocks on the workspace with each change. This code is executed on the HuCon. If you want to have a look at what has been generated, just fade in this area.

## Console
The HuCon gives you a hint if your program contains an error. You can see these hints in the console output. Additionally, you can create output on the console with the *print* function block.
