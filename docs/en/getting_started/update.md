# Update

To update your HuCon only a few steps are necessary.

Connect the HuCon to a power supply or a battery (power bank) and wait until the eyes are green.
After that, open your browser and go to the start page of the HuCon. There you will find the menu item **Settings** and below that the item **Update**.

The update can take several minutes and during the whole process the HuCon will reboot once. Afterwards the HuCon is ready for operation again.
