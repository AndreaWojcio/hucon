# Python

Your HuCon uses Python internally to be able to be programmed. So if you want to get the maximum out of your robot, just use the programming language [Python](https://www.python.org/). On the internet you can find a lot of tutorials to learn this programming language.
To program your HuCon directly in Python you just have to click on the **editor** tile on the start page.

If you don't know how to start, just have a look at the included examples. You can open all examples and save them under a new name if you have changed them.
