# Welcome

This project was created to teach children how to program a self-built robot.

The Human Controlled Robot, HuCon for short, is able to program in two ways. Depending on the individuals programming skills. For beginners, it is recommended to describe the running program with Blockly. Once you have gained experience, the HuCon can be programmed with python.

The robot can be programmed over a simple web interface. All you need is a modern browser. This ensures independence from the users' system. The interface is optimized for the use with a PC or a tablet, but it will work on smart-phones, too.

We made sure that the interfaces were Arduino compatible. This allows you to use standard products that don't cost much money.

We wish you a lot of fun programming your HuCon robot.
